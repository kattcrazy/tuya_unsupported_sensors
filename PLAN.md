-# Tuya Unsupported Sensors
-
-**Git cheatsheet**  
- `git status` → check changes  
- `git add -A` → stage everything  
- `git commit -m "short note"` → save snapshot  
- `git push` → sync to GitHub
-
-**Scope & goals**  
- Focus on Tuya sensors that the official integration misses.  
- Discover all devices via Tuya Cloud, let the user manually pick the unsupported ones.  
- Work in every region (US/EU/CN/IN/SG/JP variants).  
- Poll cloud data every 1–30 minutes (default 5).  
- Keep Tuya `customName` for devices/entities; map friendly property names (Battery, Humidity, Temperature, Contact).
